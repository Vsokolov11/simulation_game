# Burger Entites


## This is a 0 payer game I made a while ago with the Unity Engine.

**The rules are simple. The game stars on day 0, with 3 alive entities, in the huts at the edge of the plane, and some burgers for them to eat. Every entity has a health bar and a speed indicator above its head. The faster an entity moves the quicker it will lose its health and die. Every entity has a smelling range and if it senses food in this range, it goes straight to it and eats it, which resets the health of the entity. If an entity has eaten once in a day, it turns blue, if it has eaten twice, it turns red, shelters in one of the huts. After a while night falls, all uneaten burgers are destroyed and all alive entities take shelter. On the next day every entity, that has eaten twice the previous day, reproduces. Every morning new burgers are spawned. The number of the burgers is random but always enough for all entities to eat once.**

**_Things I plan on adding/fixing:_**
1. A (improved) start menu and an overall better UI 
2. Possibility to change some variables, like food count, entities count and such, from the UI.
3. Sometimes entities just ignore food.
